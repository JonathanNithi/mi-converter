# Mission Possible Converter App

This is a project which was created as a currency convertor with the help of freecurrencyapi.com. Instructions on how to pull and set this project up is given below

## Installing NodeJS

Make sure your environment has NodeJS installed in it.

## Install the necessary modules

Access the project directory after pulling the project from github. Open the terminal in the project directory and run the command npm install. This will install the necessary modules required for the project to function. 

## Adding the .env file

Since the project is added to a public repository, I have added a .env file in which the REACT_APP_API_KEY is stored. So create a .env file in the project directory. Add the following line. 

### REACT_APP_API_KEY='your-api-key-comes-here'

You can get your api-key from freecurrencyapi.com.

## Running the project

Once the above instructions are completed, now you are all set to go. So type the command
